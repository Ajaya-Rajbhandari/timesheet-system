### Plan:
1. **Review the `App.js` File**:
   - Ensure that the `ThemeProvider` is correctly wrapping all components that utilize the `useTheme` hook, including the `Layout` component.

2. **Check for Multiple Instances**:
   - Verify that the `Layout` component is not being rendered in multiple places or contexts that might bypass the `ThemeProvider`.

3. **Test the Application**:
   - After making any necessary adjustments, run the application to confirm that the error regarding `useTheme` is resolved.

4. **Implement Error Boundaries** (Optional):
   - Consider adding error boundaries around the `Layout` component to handle any future errors gracefully.

### Follow-Up Steps:
- Verify the changes in the files.
- Confirm with the user for any additional requirements or modifications.

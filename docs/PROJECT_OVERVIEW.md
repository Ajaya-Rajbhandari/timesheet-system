# Timesheet System - Project Overview

## System Purpose

A centralized timesheet management system for organizations to track employee work hours, projects, and tasks. The system emphasizes hierarchical control where managers and admins oversee employee time entries.

## Key Principles

### 1. Hierarchical Access Control

- **Admin**: Full system access and control

  - Can create/manage all user types (admin, manager, employee)
  - Access to all reports and system settings
  - System configuration authority

- **Manager**: Department/Team level control

  - Can create and manage employee accounts only
  - View and approve timesheets for their team
  - Generate team reports

- **Employee**: Basic access
  - Submit and view their own timesheets
  - View their work history
  - Cannot create or modify other users

### 2. Authentication & Security

- No public registration - users must be created by admins/managers
- Secure login system with JWT authentication
- Password reset handled through authorized personnel
- Session management and token expiration
- Audit trails for user actions

### 3. Timesheet Management

- Daily time entry with project/task tracking
- Hours validation (0-24 hours per day)
- Project-based time allocation
- Task categorization
- Comments/notes for entries

### 4. Data Management

- Centralized MongoDB database
- Data validation at model level
- Audit trails for all modifications
- Regular backups (to be implemented)

## Technical Requirements

### Backend

- Node.js + Express server
- MongoDB database
- RESTful API architecture
- JWT authentication
- Input validation
- Error handling

### Security

- Password hashing (bcrypt)
- JWT token management
- Role-based access control
- Input sanitization
- Error message security

### Testing

- Jest testing framework
- Integration tests for API endpoints
- Unit tests for utilities
- Test coverage monitoring
- In-memory MongoDB for tests

## Important Workflows

### 1. User Management

```
Admin/Manager -> Create User -> System Email -> First Login
```

### 2. Timesheet Submission

```
Employee -> Submit Timesheet -> Manager Review -> Approval/Rejection
```

### 3. Password Reset

```
User -> Request Reset -> Manager/Admin -> Generate New Password -> System Email
```

## Things to Remember

### Security Considerations

1. Never expose password hashes
2. Validate all user input
3. Implement rate limiting
4. Maintain secure session management
5. Log security events

### Business Rules

1. Only admins can create manager accounts
2. Managers can only create employee accounts
3. Employees cannot create any accounts
4. Time entries must be within 0-24 hours
5. All actions must be logged for audit

### Data Integrity

1. Maintain user action audit trails
2. Implement data validation at all levels
3. Regular database backups
4. Handle concurrent modifications
5. Maintain data consistency

### User Experience

1. Clear error messages (without exposing system details)
2. Efficient workflow processes
3. Responsive API endpoints
4. Proper status codes and responses
5. Clear activity feedback

## Implementation Phases

### Phase 1 - Core Authentication (Current)

- ✓ Basic user model with roles
- ✓ Login endpoint
- ✓ User creation for admins/managers
- ✓ JWT token implementation
- ✓ Basic test coverage

### Phase 2 - Timesheet Management

- Timesheet model enhancement
- CRUD operations for timesheets
- Validation rules
- Manager approval workflow
- Reporting basics

### Phase 3 - Advanced Features

- Password reset workflow
- Email notifications
- Audit logging
- Advanced reporting
- Data export capabilities

### Phase 4 - Security Enhancements

- Rate limiting
- Enhanced session management
- Security logging
- Input sanitization
- API documentation

## Monitoring & Maintenance

- Error logging
- Performance monitoring
- Security audits
- Regular backups
- Documentation updates

## Future Considerations

1. Department/Team structure
2. Project management integration
3. Leave management
4. Mobile application
5. API versioning
6. Analytics dashboard

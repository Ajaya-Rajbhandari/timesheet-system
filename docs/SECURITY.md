# Security Documentation

This document outlines the security measures implemented in the Timesheet System application.

## Authentication & Authorization

### Authentication Flow

1. User submits credentials (username/password)
2. Server validates credentials against hashed password in database
3. If valid, server generates JWT token with user information and role
4. Token is returned to client and stored in memory/localStorage
5. Token is included in Authorization header for subsequent requests
6. Server validates token for each protected route

### Password Security

- Passwords are hashed using bcrypt with configurable salt rounds
- Password strength requirements enforced:
  - Minimum length (configurable, default 8)
  - Uppercase letters
  - Lowercase letters
  - Numbers
  - Special characters
- Failed login attempts are tracked and can trigger account lockout
- Password reset tokens have short expiration times

### Token Security

- JWT tokens include expiration time
- Refresh token rotation for extended sessions
- Tokens are validated on every request
- Token payload includes only necessary user information
- Tokens are signed with a strong secret

## API Security

### Request Validation

- Input validation on all endpoints
- Data sanitization to prevent injection attacks
- Rate limiting on authentication endpoints
- CORS configuration to restrict origins

### Response Security

- Security headers on all responses:
  - Content-Security-Policy
  - X-XSS-Protection
  - X-Content-Type-Options
  - X-Frame-Options
  - Referrer-Policy
  - Strict-Transport-Security (in production)
  - Permissions-Policy
- No sensitive data in responses
- Consistent error messages that don't leak information

## Data Protection

### Sensitive Data Handling

- Environment variables for all secrets and credentials
- No hardcoded secrets in code
- Database credentials protected
- API keys and secrets managed securely

### Database Security

- Connections use authentication
- Sensitive fields excluded from query results
- Proper indexing to prevent DoS attacks
- Data validation before storage

## Monitoring & Logging

### Audit Logging

- Authentication events logged
- Authorization failures logged
- Admin actions logged
- Logs exclude sensitive information
- Structured logging format for analysis

### Security Monitoring

- Failed authentication attempts tracked
- Unusual access patterns can be detected
- Rate limiting helps prevent brute force attacks

## Development Practices

### Secure Coding

- Dependencies regularly updated
- Security-focused code reviews
- No sensitive information in comments or logs
- Proper error handling

### Environment Configuration

- Different configurations for development/production
- Required security variables validated on startup
- Secure defaults for optional settings

## Deployment Security

### Production Safeguards

- HTTPS enforced in production
- Strict security headers
- Environment validation prevents startup with missing security variables
- Rate limiting and other protections automatically enabled

## Security Testing

### Automated Checks

- Pre-commit hooks to detect secrets
- Security-focused tests
- Authentication and authorization tests

## Incident Response

### Security Vulnerabilities

If you discover a security vulnerability, please do NOT open an issue. Email [security@example.com](mailto:security@example.com) instead.

## Security Checklist for Developers

- [ ] Never commit `.env` files with real credentials
- [ ] Use the `.env.example` template for required variables
- [ ] Ensure all user inputs are validated
- [ ] Don't log sensitive information
- [ ] Keep dependencies updated
- [ ] Follow the principle of least privilege for API endpoints
- [ ] Use the authentication middleware for protected routes
- [ ] Implement proper role checks for authorization
- [ ] Test security measures before deployment
